# Tweets

---

Tweets is an application that consists of user cards and has little
interactivity. When clicking on the "Follow" button, the text changes to
"Following", and the total number of followers changes, and our user is added to
it. Also, the tweets page has a "Go back" button that leads to the main page,
which allows the user to quickly and without problems go to the main page of
"Nome".

The application was created using
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

And connected to the [mocapi.io](https://mockapi.io/) server to display the list
of users.

The following libraries are used in the project:

- reduxjs/toolkit;
- react-router-dom;
- redux-persist;
- emotion/styled;
- axios.
