This is a small application consisting of user cards. A small interactivity has
been added, when you click on the Follow button, the text changes to Following,
and there is also an opportunity to increase the number of followers by 1.

The application was created using

of users.

The following libraries are used in the project:

- reduxjs/toolkit;
- react-router-dom;
- redux-persist;
- emotion/styled;
- axios.
